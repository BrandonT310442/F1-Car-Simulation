##F1 Car Physics Simulation
This repository contains a physics simulation of an F1 car, including calculations for dynamics and kinematics. The simulation allows the user to control the car using arrow keys, and provides real-time calculations of velocity, acceleration, and other kinematic parameters. The simulation also includes calculations for various forces acting on the car, such as friction and aerodynamic drag. Additionally, there is a velocity-time graph that provides a visual representation of the car's speed over time.

##Features
Real-time physics simulation of an F1 car.
User-friendly interface using arrow keys to control the car's movement.
Calculations for velocity, acceleration, and other kinematic parameters.
Calculation of various forces acting on the car, including friction and aerodynamic drag.
Customizable settings for top speed and braking force.
Velocity-time graph for visualizing the car's speed over time.

##Usage
To use the F1 car physics simulation, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/BrandonT310442/Phyics-ISP/new/main?readme=1
Open the repository in your preferred programming environment.

Navigate to the main simulation file, index.html, and run the file.

Once the simulation starts, you can control the car using the arrow keys. Press the up arrow to accelerate, the down arrow to brake, and the left/right arrows to steer.

As you control the car, the simulation will display real-time calculations for velocity, acceleration, and other kinematic parameters.

Letting go of the up arrow will apply the braking force. 

You can customize the top speed and braking force settings in the simulation code to modify the car's performance according to your preferences.

To view the velocity-time graph, you can access the graph window within the simulation user interface. The graph will show the car's speed over time, allowing you to analyze its acceleration and deceleration patterns.
